Allow more configuration. Specifically in image creation - how to let users chose file name.
ForkIO the image creation.
ForkOS the openGL rendering - low priority
More Fractals :
	Basic escape fratals - julia, newton, burning ship, ^n etc.
	Bhuddabrots
	Fractal Flames
Supersampling (other aliasing) for images [Probably not for live rendering]
Better Colouring options.
Possibly arty filters.
User specified fractals and colouring etc. Some sort of parser / dsl.
Mouse Support (left click centre and zoom, right click centre, selection box?).
Eventually - Some sort of GUI.
