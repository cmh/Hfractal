--Urgent
Description for hackage. (Also haddock docs?)


--Important
Colouring from a Pallete - Data.Colour
Arbitray precision floats
Allow more configuration. Specifically in image creation - how to let users chose file name.
More Fractals :
	Basic escape fratals - julia, newton, burning ship, ^n etc.
	Bhuddabrots
	Fractal Flames

--Would be nice

ForkOS the openGL rendering - low priority
Supersampling (other aliasing) for images [Probably not for live rendering]
Better Colouring options.
Possibly arty filters.
User specified fractals and colouring etc. Some sort of parser / dsl.
Eventually - Some sort of GUI.
DONT allow resizing of window - currently too much of a headache
