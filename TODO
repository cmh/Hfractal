--Urgent
Description for hackage. (Also haddock docs?)

--Important
Colouring - Using a colour space / pallette rather than trig functions (more efficient and look better)
Allow more configuration. Specifically in image creation - how to let users chose file name.
More Fractals :
	Basic escape fratals - julia, newton, burning ship, ^n etc.
	Bhuddabrots
	Fractal Flames

--Would be nice

ForkOS the openGL rendering - low priority
Better Colouring options.
Possibly arty filters.
User specified fractals and colouring etc. Some sort of parser / dsl.
Eventually - Some sort of GUI.
DONT allow resizing of window - currently too much of a headache
