Arbitray precision floats (or larger fixes precision e.g. qd)
Better threading -  ForkOS the openGL rendering 
Fix window resizing
Fix doubledisplay for each keypress

UI design:
	GUI
	button to reset position
	button to cycle through fractal types

Things I want to do in the immediate future:
    - Move to Vector
    - Move the concurrent code to a chan based producer/consumer model
    - Colour on the shader - write to textures instead of using gldrawpoints
